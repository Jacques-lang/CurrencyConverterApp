This program is a currency conversion application built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Here is a step-by-step description of what the program does:

1. **Imports Required Libraries**:
   - `tkinter` for creating the GUI.
   - `requests` for making HTTP requests to the currency conversion API.
   - `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for handling images.

2. **Defines the `get_currency` Function**:
   - Retrieves the amount to be converted from the user input.
   - Validates that the amount is a positive number.
   - Retrieves the base currency and the target currency from the user input.
   - Makes an API request to the ExchangeRate-API to get the latest conversion rates.
   - If the API request is successful, it calculates the converted amount and updates the GUI with the result.
   - If there is an error (e.g., invalid currency code or network issue), it shows an error message.

3. **Sets Up the GUI**:
   - Creates the main application window.
   - Loads and displays an image (`appPic.png`).
   - Adds text fields for the user to input the amount, base currency, and target currency.
   - Adds a button that triggers the `get_currency` function when clicked.
   - Adds a label to display the conversion result.

4. **Runs the Main Event Loop**:
   - Starts the Tkinter event loop to keep the application running and responsive to user interactions.
